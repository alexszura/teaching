## CMSE 491: Bioinformatics and Computational Biology

This course is an introduction to contemporary topics in bioinformatics and computational biology, dealing with combining large-scale data and modern analytical techniques to answer biological questions. In each topic, centered around a recent paper, we discuss the major biological & biomedical questions, explore the relevant biological/genomics/biomedical datasets, and understand the underlying statistical, probabilistic, & machine-learning approaches.

Students will learn how to formulate problems for quantitative inquiry, design computational projects, understand and think critically about data & methods, communicate research findings, perform reproducible research, and practice open science. Students will apply all these by carrying out a group project utilizing large-scale datasets to answer biological questions using custom-written software. They will present this project in class and submit a report at the end of the course.

### Outline of major topics to be covered (**subject to changes**):
* Genome assembly and annotation
* Sequence alignment and pattern finding
