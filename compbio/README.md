# CMSE 491: Bioinformatics and Computational Biology

This course is an introduction to contemporary topics in bioinformatics and computational biology, dealing with combining large-scale data and modern analytical techniques to gain biological/biomedical insights. In each topic, centered around a recent paper, we discuss the major biological & biomedical questions, explore the relevant molecular/genomics/biomedical datasets, and understand the underlying statistical, probabilistic, & machine-learning approaches.

Students will learn how to formulate problems for quantitative inquiry, design computational projects, understand and think critically about data & methods, communicate research findings, perform reproducible research, and practice open science. Students will apply all these by carrying out a group project, presenting their project in class, and submit a report at the end of the course.

### Outline of major topics to be covered (**subject to changes**):
* Genome assembly and annotation
* Sequence alignment and pattern finding
* Comparative genomics
* Genetic variation and quantitative genetic data analysis
* Regulatory genomics
* Functional genomics and data integration
* Molecular and digital evolution
* Molecular dynamics
* Protein residue coupling and structure prediction
* Modeling cellular pathways
* Metabolomics and metabolic flux analysis
* Large-scale biological networks

### Schedule
