#### For Windows Users
[Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0PjTAylwoU) <br>
Install R by downloading and running [this `.exe` file from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm).
Also, please install the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
