## Bioinformatics and Computational Biology
This course is an introduction to contemporary topics in bioinformatics and computational biology, dealing with combining large-scale data and modern analytical techniques to answer biological questions. In each topic, centered around a recent paper, we discuss the major biological & biomedical questions, explore the relevant biological/genomics/biomedical datasets, and understand the underlying statistical, probabilistic, & machine-learning approaches.

Students will learn how to formulate problems for quantitative inquiry, design computational projects, understand and think critically about data & methods, communicate research findings, perform reproducible research, and practice open science. Students will apply all these by carrying out a group project utilizing large-scale datasets to answer biological questions using custom-written software. They will present this project in class and submit a report at the end of the course.

## Modular Courses in Bioinformatics
These courses cover similar material to the August workshops, but use the flipped-classroom philosophy of having students watch video lectures online and come to class to apply the tools to real data.Â Each module is worth 1 credit.

## Bioinformatics Workshops
These bioinformatics workshops provide training in Linux/R/Python programming, Statistical data analysis and visualization, and Analysis of various types of genomic data (e.g. RNA-seq).
