## Bioinformatics and Computational Biology
This course is an introduction to contemporary topics in bioinformatics and computational biology that deal with combining large-scale data and modern analytical techniques to answer biological questions.

Using a series of recent papers, we:
- Discuss major biological & biomedical topics,
- Explore big genomics & biomedical datasets, and
- Understand the underlying statistical, probabilistic, & machine-learning approaches.

[Spring 2018]

## Modular Courses in Bioinformatics
These courses cover similar material to the August workshops, but use the flipped-classroom philosophy of having students watch video lectures online and come to class to apply the tools to real data.Â Each module is worth 1 credit.
