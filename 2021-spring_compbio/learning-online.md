# Learning Online
Folks, hope all of you are doing ok in these surely difficult circumstances. I hope you are taking all the precautions to keep you and everyone around you safe and unaffected:
* If you think you came in contact with anyone sick, please self-quarantine for a couple of weeks.
* Try to maintain 2-3m distance from your neighbors. Avoid handshakes/hugs.
* Use hand-sanitizers and wipe surfaces with disinfectant wipes when outside.
* Wash hands frequently and thoroughly with soap, each time for 20+s. Do not touch your face (eyes, nose, mouth) or food until you do so.
* Eat and drink healthy – keep your immune system strong!
* All this is also to avoid being carriers and re-infecting others, especially people more vulnerable than you.

Since we are going completely online for the rest of our semester including the finals, I am making a bunch of adjustments to deliver this class as effectively possible and I will work on helping you master the remaining course material as best I (and you) can in these circumstances. There is a lot in here but read through these carefully.

## 1. Important Links
### Permanent Zoom Meeting ID
The link is available in the #GoingOnline post on our class Slack.

### All Schedules
The google sheet shared on Slack contains the schedule/assignments for:
- Paper presentations
- Midterm/Final project presentations
- Office hours (appointments)

## 2. Zoom Best Practices
* If you haven’t done so already, please register your MSU Zoom account http://msu.zoom.us/
* Please use a headphone (if you can) so that we can avoid audio feedback.
* All your microphones will be muted and video will be turned off by default.
* Use the chat feature to ask questions or provide comments. I will make sure I look and respond to them.
* You can "raise your hand” on Zoom when you wish to talk and I will unmute you.

## 3. Midterm Presentations – March 16, 18, 20
We are going to use the Zoom meeting room.
* Check the “Mid-term Project Presentations” sheet in the google sheet with the schedule for the details on who is presenting when.
* Please log-in in a timely manner because we are on a tight schedule.
    * Each of you gets 6 min to talk and another 3 min for Q&A.
* By default, everyone will be on mute except the speaker.
* When it is your turn to present, I will unmute you and you can share your screen to present.
* The rest of us will listen and post questions/comments on chat. The speaker will look through the chat and answer questions one by one.
* Remember: presenting remotely over Zoom sitting all by yourself is pretty odd and lonely. So, it is up to the rest of us to encourage each other by engaging with the speaker as much as possible via questions/comments.

## 4. Lectures
We are going to use the Zoom meeting room.
* By default, everyone will be on mute except me.
* I will share my screen with the lecture slides.
* I will also share the lecture slides beforehand on the class website so that you can follow along better.
* It is more important now (online) than before (in-person) to stop me and ask questions and/or provide your thoughts. If you’re confused about something I’m presenting, it is extremely likely that others are also confused about that. So, you will be helping a lot of people by stopping me to ask questions and clarify things.
* As and when you think of them, post your questions/comments on chat. I will look through the chat window and answer questions as they come.
* As usual, I will pause several times to ask questions. When I do so, I will expect many of you to chime-in via chat to give me brief answers. Based on what I see, I may umute and ask specific individuals to elaborate.
* I will keep my input volume high to ensure that what I’m saying is clear. If I’m at a high volume, you can always turn down your audio; it’s harder for you to turn it up enough if I speak too softly.
* Finally, since it is hard to pay attention to online/zoom lectures on a computer screen, I will also record my lectures as I present them via zoom and share them with you at the end of the day. But, I’m not going to do any slick editing. So, you’ll be subject to the entire zoom session as-is.

## 5. Student Paper Presentations on Fridays
We are going to use the Zoom meeting room and the style will be similar to how you did your mid-term presentations.
* Check the “Paper Presentations” sheet in the google sheet with the schedule.
* By default, everyone will be on mute except the speaker.
* When it is your turn to present, I will unmute you and you can share your screen to present.
* The rest of us will listen and post questions/comments on chat. The speaker will look through the chat and answer questions one by one.
* Remember: presenting remotely over Zoom sitting all by yourself is pretty odd and lonely. So, it is up to the rest of us to encourage each other by engaging with the speaker as much as possible via questions/comments.

## 6. Class Participation
I hope you understand that I’m looking for ways to ensure you’re present and paying attention.
* Please log-in in a timely manner. I would like to see you listed as one of the participants.
* During each lecture, I would like to receive from *each of you*, via chat, at least:
    * One question to clarify something I’m saying, and
    * One answer to a question I’m posing.
* Remember that presenting remotely over Zoom sitting all by yourself is pretty odd, lonely, and lacking in nonverbal feedback (nodding heads, puzzled looks, drowsy eyes, etc.). So, when someone is presenting, as listeners, it is our responsibility to encourage the speaker by engaging with the them as much as possible via questions/comments/answers.
* Finally, I am cognizant of the fact that you are at home/residence and each of you will have a unique circumstance in terms of convenience of working environment, other family-members/roommates, childcare/pet-care needs, spotty internet, etc. All of us will fully accommodate any of this.

## 7. Office Hours
We are going to use Slack video calls to do all our office hours.
* I have added an extra hour during the week. So, now we’ll hold virtual office hours from 5–6 pm on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.
* Go to the “Office hours” sheet in the google sheet with the schedule and put your name down on the day/time of your choice. Naturally, this will be on a first-come-first-serve basis. I will give you a call at the chosen time.
* We will use this same sheet every week. At the end of each week, I will clear this table and it'll be ready for the next week.

## 8. Final Presentations – April 30
Some preliminary thoughts here. This will be solidified soon.
* Use Zoom to record a 5 min video of your poster presentation and submit by the due date.
* Assigned reviewers will view the video and give scores. A detailed rubric will be provided ahead of time.
* All of us will then meet via Zoom during the Finals hour on April 30 to discuss all the projects. During this time, three others who are not assigned reviewers will ask questions they have prepared.

## 9. Class Timeline
At the outset:
* The class timeline, including deadlines, remain intact.
* The only change is that we’re going to do everything – my lecture discussions, your Friday paper presentations, office hours, and midterm/final project presentations – via Zoom and Slack.

However, I want to qualify this wish:
* My point is that we should strive to keep the structure the class as much as possible and prevent the class from straying far from what it was intended to be and what you signed-up for.
* I am also aware that, during these difficult circumstances, we all need a simultaneous dose of structure and flexibility.
* So, as always, I am very happy to work with you on a case-by-case basis to figure out different assignments and due dates based on your specific circumstances/needs.

### Finally, all the physical distancing we are doing to mitigate the spread of infection can lead to a lot of stress. The isolation is not great for mental health and the confinement is not great for physical health. To help you a little in mitigating these effects, here are some additional things we will do as a class.

## 10. Virtual Meetings with Your Learning Group
Take advantage of the in-class learning groups you are part of. I am asking you to meet remotely with your learning group once every week – perhaps on Thursday or before class on Friday – over a video call. You can coordinate the time works for all of you and how you will do the video call. When you meet online, you can:
* Go over the lecture slides for that week and ask/answer questions.
* Discuss the assignment due on Friday.
* Bring unresolved questions to the Friday online class and ask me those Qs.
* Or, just say HI and continue to do your work in the company of your peers.

## 11. Scrum
I have created a #scrum channel in our class Slack. Let's use this channel to do a daily scrum to help each other keep their work – *any school/professional work*, not just what's related to this class – on-track. Include studying, preparation, reading, etc.
* At the beginning of each day you're working, post brief but specific answers to the following three Qs in this channel:
    1. What did you do yesterday? [“Yesterday, I …“]
    2. What will you do today? [“Today, I'm going to …“]
    3. Are there any impediments in your way?
* Note that scrum is not for:
    * Problem-solving or issue resolution.
    * Status updates or evaluating progress.
    * Checking on anyone.
* All issues raised here should be discussed further elsewhere, perhaps one-on-one or in group channels and with the relevant people.

## 12. Health & Workout
I have created a #health-workout channel on our class Slack. Let's use this channel to share our ideas and post our daily plans/goals for keeping up our mental and physical health.
* You can post something at the beginning of the day to motivate yourself and others, and to get help from others to hold you accountable.
* Doesn't have to 100 pushups. Like it is for me, even stretching for 10 min and drinking 1.5L of water is a worthy goal!!

## 13. Fun
I have created a #fun channel on our class Slack. Let's use this channel to share your ideas/plans for engaging in a hobby or just disengaging with a Netflix show.
* Keep them coming as when you find/take-on something new – yoga, online multiplayer games, new TV series, anything!

## 14. Frequently Asked Questions
**Q. Can I connect to zoom by dialing a phone number?**  
A. Yes, additional details are in the #GoingOnline post on Slack.
