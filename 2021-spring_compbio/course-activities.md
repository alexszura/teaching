# Course Activities

## In-class Participation
Each week is dedicated to one module where we will discuss multiple topics. For each module, Arjun will give lectures on Monday, Wednesday, and half of Friday. Then, one or two students (based on a pre-determined schedule) lead a discussion based on a paper relevant to that module.

### Lecture
During the lectures, Arjun will teach critcal concepts while frequently soliciting comments, questions, and answers. Learners will also be asked to engage in group-based activities following specified prompts.

### Paper discussion
You will also take turns to present the assigned paper during each topic's "Paper discussion" class. Make sure you sign-up.
- Two students together present each paper.
- The presentation should focus on the computational/analytical parts, not necessarily on detailed biological background & conclusions.
    1. What is the problem the authors are trying to solve? [description of the problem along with why it is important]
    2. What are their claims about the _then_ current practices and their limitations? [existing approaches to solve the problem & their pros-and-cons]
    3. What’s their approach? What’s new in it and what is their rationale for it being potentially successful? [description of the *new ideas*, their *merits* in comparison to existing ones, and *rationale*]
    4. What are the major contributions and limitations of this paper?
    5. What are some open questions and next steps (for addressing the limitations)?

Your role as a learner in this class is to:
- Do the pre-class assignments and additional readings.
- Show up to class.
- Work in groups during in-class discussion sessions.
- **Ask questions** about computational or biological concepts (because no one will have the perfect background).
- Correct me when I am wrong.

## Assignments
For each topic, you will be given an assignment after the topic's first "Lecture" class on Monday that you are required to work on and submit before beginning of the "paper discussion" class on Friday the same week. Links to the assignment will be posted on this page next to the topic on the [Calendar](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/blob/master/2021-spring_compbio/schedule-lectures-assignments.md#calendar) and specific instructions will be posted on Slack.

## Semester Project and Presentation
A major goal of this course is to prepare you for performing original research in computational biology, and for effectively presenting your ideas and research. The semester project will serve as the most practical way to do exactly that.

Projects can take any one of the following flavors:
- Design and implement a new computational method for a task in biology
- Improve an existing method
- Perform an evaluation of several existing methods
- Develop a fully-reproducible documentation and codebase for an existing analysis in a paper

### Expected final outcomes
The outcomes of this semester-long project should include:
1. Well-documented code to:
    - download and process the data
    - perform the computational analysis and generate all the results
    - visualize the results as various plots
2. Detailed final report containing the following sections:
    - Abstract
    - Introduction
    - Data and Methods
    - Results and Discussion
    - Limitations and Future Directions
    - References
    - Glossary
3. A poster that describes your project - motivation, exact problem, approach, results, discussion & conclusions, limitations & future direcrtions, acknowledgements.

### Project milestones throughout the semester
There are **ten [project milestones](https://github.com/krishnanlab/teaching/blob/master/2021-spring_compbio/schedule-lectures-assignments.md#project-milestones)** throughout the course that will help you stay on track, enabling you to complete a substantial project.

#### 1. Reserach profile | Due: Fri, Jan 22
Describe your previous research, areas of research interest in bioinformatics / computational-biology, type of project that best fits your interests. Post this description in a profile that lets your classmates know you.

#### 2. Project topics | Due: Fri, Jan 29
Discuss with Arjun (and any other PI) and read recent papers. Briefly describe project ideas.

#### 3. Project pre-proposal | Due: Fri, Feb 05
Prepare a two-page pre-proposal (Page1: text; Page2: figures & references).

#### 4. Project proposal | Due: Fri, Feb 19
Write full proposal
    - Length: 5-pages (incl. figures & ref; sections listed below)
    - Sections:
        - *Background, goals, & significance* (what is the problem you are hoping to address; what is the current approach & its limitations; what will you do & why is it likely to succeed; if successful, what is the broader impact)
        - *Datasets* (what datasets will you use; where are they from; what exactly do they contain; how are they formatted)
        - *Computational methods/approach* (what are the analytical methods; what are the specific software implementations you'll use; include your flowchart here)
        - *Evaluation plan* (how will you evaluate the results that you get; think in terms of how to test if a) your approach is working correctly without errors and b) your results make quantitative/biological sense and are meaningful)
        - *Potential challenges & alternative approaches* (what are some assumptions you are making that can fail; what are some potential limitations of your dataset or approach that might prevent you from achieving your aforementioned goals; what will you do as alternatives if you hit those limitations)
        - *Specific milestones* (what is the list of specific results/outcomes you will work on getting)

#### 5. Proposal reviews | Due: Fri, Feb 26
Review proposals. Discuss proposal with Arjun.

#### 6. Mid-course project presentations | Due: Wed, Mar 10
Make sure to include the following information in your presentation:
    - Address peer evaluations, revise aims, scope, and list of final goals & deliverables.
    - Meet with Arjun about reviews, revised plan, and progress.
    - In addition to the usual things – background, problem, approach, etc. – I would like you to also present the following:
        - Clear flowchart of approach.
            - Raw data → Preprocessing & quality control → Preliminary/exploratory analysis → Analysis/Model-building steps → Expected outcomes.
        - Thorough exploration and sanity checks of data.
            - Tables & plots to showcase various aspects of your datasets/problem.
        - Method/software.
            - Usage & I/O format for each.
        - Preliminary analysis
            - With simple baselines, samples datasets, and toy examples.

#### 7. Mid-course project presentation reviews | Due: Fri, Mar 12

#### 8. Mid-course project report | Due: Fri, Mar 19
Continue making substantial progress on proposed milestones. Write mid-course project report.

#### 9. Final project report | Due: Wed, Apr 21
Complete milestones, finalize results, figures, write-up in conference publication format. As part of the report, comment on your overall project experience.

#### 10. Final project poster presentations | Thr, Apr 29, 12:45 – 2:45p
